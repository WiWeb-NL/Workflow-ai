{/* MANUAL-CONTENT-START:intro */}
[X](https://x.com/) (formerly Twitter) is a popular social media platform that enables real-time communication, content sharing, and engagement with audiences worldwide.

The X integration in Visual Workflow AI leverages OAuth authentication to securely connect with the X API, allowing your agents to interact with the platform programmatically. This OAuth implementation ensures secure access to X's features while maintaining user privacy and security.

With the X integration, your agents can:

- **Post content**: Create new tweets, reply to existing conversations, or share media directly from your workflows
- **Monitor conversations**: Track mentions, keywords, or specific accounts to stay informed about relevant discussions
- **Engage with audiences**: Automatically respond to mentions, direct messages, or specific triggers
- **Analyze trends**: Gather insights from trending topics, hashtags, or user engagement patterns
- **Research information**: Search for specific content, user profiles, or conversations to inform agent decisions

In Visual Workflow AI, the X integration enables sophisticated social media automation scenarios. Your agents can monitor brand mentions and respond appropriately, schedule and publish content based on specific triggers, conduct social listening for market research, or create interactive experiences that span both conversational AI and social media engagement. By connecting Visual Workflow AI with X through OAuth, you can build intelligent agents that maintain a consistent and responsive social media presence while adhering to platform policies and best practices for API usage.
