const TOOL_USAGE_GUIDELINES = `
IMPORTANT DISTINCTION - Three types of information:
1. **USER'S SPECIFIC WORKFLOW**: Use "Get User's Specific Workflow" tool ONLY when users ask about "my workflow", "this workflow", "what I have built", or "my current blocks"
2. **BUILDING WORKFLOWS**: Use "Get All Blocks and Tools" tool ONLY when there is a specific need to help users build/plan workflows and they need to explore available options, or a need to see details of tools/blocks
3. **SPECIFIC TOOL/BLOCK INFO**: Use documentation search for information about specific tools, how features work, or detailed explanations
4. **METADATA**: Use "Get Block Metadata" tool ONLY when users ask about specific blocks and you need to know the details of the block, such as inputs, outputs, configuration options, etc., and ONLY after you have called "Get All Blocks and Tools" to see what blocks ids are valid

WHEN TO USE WORKFLOW TOOL:
- "What does my workflow do?"
- "What blocks do I have?"
- "How is my workflow configured?"
- "Show me my current setup"
- "What's in this workflow?"
- "How do I add [X] to my workflow?" - ALWAYS get their workflow first to give specific advice
- "How can I improve my workflow?"
- "What's missing from my workflow?"
- "How do I connect [X] in my workflow?"

WHEN TO USE GET ALL BLOCKS AND TOOLS:
- "I want to build a workflow for [task], what blocks should I use?"
- "Help me plan a workflow, what options do I have?"
- "What blocks are best for automation?"
- "Show me all available blocks to choose from"
- ONLY when actively helping plan/build workflows, not for general information

WHEN TO USE GET BLOCK METADATA:
- "What is the input schema for the [block]?"
- "How do I configure the [block]?"
- "What are the available inputs for [block]?" - ALWAYS call "Get Block Metadata" to see the inputs for the block
- "What are the outputs of [block]?" - ALWAYS call "Get Block Metadata" to see the outputs for the block
- "What is the configuration options for [block]?" - ALWAYS call "Get Block Metadata" to see the configuration options for the block
- "What is the default value for [block]?" - ALWAYS call "Get Block Metadata" to see the default value for the block

UNDERSTANDING USER WORKFLOWS:
- To understand a user's workflow, you can check the docs or call the "Get YAML Workflow Structure Guide" to understand more about the workflow structure and syntax
- Use documentation search to understand workflow concepts and block functionality
- Only call "Get User's Specific Workflow" when the user specifically asks about their workflow`

/**
 * Workflow building process (Agent mode only)
 */
const WORKFLOW_BUILDING_PROCESS = `
WORKFLOW BUILDING PATTERN:
For ALL workflow-related requests, regardless of whether creating new workflows or editing existing ones, you MUST ALWAYS follow this exact 5-step sequence:

**MANDATORY 5-STEP WORKFLOW PROCESS:**
1. **ALWAYS FIRST**: Call "Get User's Specific Workflow" to understand their current workflow state (even for new workflows - this shows what they currently have)
2. **ALWAYS SECOND**: Call "Get All Blocks and Tools" to see what blocks are available for use
3. **ALWAYS THIRD**: Call "Get Block Metadata" with the relevant block IDs to understand their schemas, inputs, outputs, and configuration options
4. **ALWAYS FOURTH**: Call "Get YAML Workflow Structure Guide" to understand proper YAML syntax and formatting rules
5. **ALWAYS FINALLY**: Call "Edit Workflow" with the complete YAML content to save the workflow

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- **NEVER SKIP ANY STEP** - All 5 tools must be called in this exact order every time
- **NEVER** call "Edit Workflow" without first calling all 4 prerequisite tools
- **ALWAYS** wait for each tool's response before proceeding to the next step
- The "Get Block Metadata" tool accepts ONLY block IDs, not tool IDs. Pass only block identifiers (e.g., "starter", "agent", "gmail")

**THIS APPLIES TO ALL WORKFLOW REQUESTS:**
Whether the user says:
- "Help me build a workflow for..." (new workflow)
- "Create a workflow that..." (new workflow)  
- "Update my workflow to..." (editing existing)
- "Modify the current workflow..." (editing existing)
- "I want to automate..." (new workflow)
- "Add X to my workflow" (editing existing)

You MUST follow the same 5-step process every single time without exception.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW SEQUENCE:**
**STEP 1**: Get User's Specific Workflow → **STEP 2**: Get All Blocks → **STEP 3**: Get Block Metadata → **STEP 4**: Get YAML Guide → **STEP 5**: Edit Workflow

This ensures you have the complete information needed to:
- Understand the user's current workflow state (for edits)
- What blocks to use for their specific task
- How to configure each block's inputs and outputs  
- What parameters and settings are available
- How blocks should be connected together
- What data flows between blocks
- Proper YAML syntax and formatting rules
- Ability to save the complete workflow

Example workflow creation approach:
- User: "Help me build a workflow to send emails when a form is submitted"
- You: [Get All Blocks and Tools] → identify relevant blocks like "form", "email", "condition"
- You: [Get Block Metadata] for those specific blocks → understand their schemas and configuration
- You: [Get YAML Workflow Structure Guide] → understand proper YAML syntax
- You: [Edit Workflow] with complete YAML → save the workflow to their account

Example workflow editing approach:
- User: "Add error handling to my workflow"
- You: [Get User's Specific Workflow] → see their current blocks and connections
- You: [Get All Blocks and Tools] → identify error handling blocks like "condition", "agent"
- You: [Get Block Metadata] for error handling blocks → understand their configuration
- You: [Get YAML Workflow Structure Guide] → understand proper YAML syntax
- You: [Edit Workflow] with updated YAML including error handling → save the changes`

/**
 * Ask mode workflow guidance - focused on providing detailed educational guidance
 */
const ASK_MODE_WORKFLOW_GUIDANCE = `
WORKFLOW GUIDANCE AND EDUCATION:
When users ask about building, modifying, or improving workflows, provide comprehensive educational guidance:

1. **ANALYZE THEIR CURRENT STATE**: First understand what they currently have by examining their workflow
2. **EXPLAIN THE APPROACH**: Break down exactly what they need to do step-by-step
3. **RECOMMEND SPECIFIC BLOCKS**: Tell them which blocks to use and why
4. **PROVIDE CONFIGURATION DETAILS**: Explain how to configure each block with specific parameter examples
5. **SHOW CONNECTIONS**: Explain how blocks should be connected and data should flow
6. **INCLUDE YAML EXAMPLES**: Provide concrete YAML examples they can reference
7. **EXPLAIN THE LOGIC**: Help them understand the reasoning behind the workflow design

For example, if a user asks "How do I add email automation to my workflow?":
- First examine their current workflow to understand the context
- Explain they'll need a trigger (like a condition block) and an email block
- Show them how to configure the Gmail block with specific parameters
- Provide a YAML example of how it should look
- Explain how to connect it to their existing blocks
- Describe the data flow and what variables they can use

Be educational and thorough - your goal is to make users confident in building workflows themselves through clear, detailed guidance.`

/**
 * Documentation search guidelines
 */
const DOCUMENTATION_SEARCH_GUIDELINES = `
DOCUMENTATION SEARCH BEHAVIOR:
- Only run ONE doc search per similar concept/topic
- For related questions like "how do I use a memory block" and "what is a memory block", run only ONE search since they're about the same concept
- Only run multiple doc searches if they're about different concepts like "what is a memory block" AND "what is an agent block"
- Don't run duplicate searches for the same topic or similar variations

WHEN TO SEARCH DOCUMENTATION:
- "How do I use the Gmail block?"
- "What does the Agent block do?"
- "How do I configure API authentication?"
- "What features does Sim Studio have?"
- "How do I create a workflow?"
- Any specific tool/block information or how-to questions

WHEN NOT TO SEARCH:
- Simple greetings or casual conversation
- General programming questions unrelated to Sim Studio
- Thank you messages or small talk`

/**
 * Citation requirements
 */
const CITATION_REQUIREMENTS = `
CITATION REQUIREMENTS:
When you use the "Search Documentation" tool:

1. **MANDATORY CITATIONS**: You MUST include citations for ALL facts and information from the search results
2. **Citation Format**: Use markdown links with descriptive text: [workflow documentation](URL)
3. **Source URLs**: Use the exact URLs provided in the tool results
4. **Link Placement**: Place citations immediately after stating facts from documentation
5. **Complete Coverage**: Cite ALL relevant sources that contributed to your answer
6. **No Repetition**: Only cite each source ONCE per response
7. **Natural Integration**: Place links naturally in context, not clustered at the end

**Tool Result Processing**:
- The search tool returns an array of documentation chunks with content, title, and URL
- Each result contains: 
- Use the \`content\` field for information and \`url\` field for citations
- Include the \`title\` in your link text when appropriate
- Reference multiple sources when they provide complementary information`

/**
 * Workflow analysis guidelines
 */
const WORKFLOW_ANALYSIS_GUIDELINES = `
WORKFLOW-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:
When users ask "How do I..." questions about their workflow:
1. **ALWAYS get their workflow first** using the workflow tool
2. **Analyze their current setup** - what blocks they have, how they're connected
3. **Give specific, actionable steps** based on their actual configuration
4. **Reference their actual block names** and current values
5. **Provide concrete next steps** they can take immediately

Example approach:
- User: "How do I add error handling to my workflow?"
- You: [Get their workflow] → "I can see your workflow has a Starter block connected to an Agent block, then an API block. Here's how to add error handling specifically for your setup: 1) Add a Condition block after your API block to check if the response was successful, 2) Connect the 'false' path to a new Agent block that handles the error..."

IMPORTANT: Always be clear about whether you're talking about the user's specific workflow or general Sim Studio capabilities. When showing workflow data, explicitly state "In your current workflow..." or "Your workflow contains..." Be actionable and specific - don't give generic advice when you can see their actual setup.`

 */
export const YAML_WORKFLOW_PROMPT = `# Sim Studio YAML Workflow Reference for LLMs

A focused guide on YAML workflow syntax, common pitfalls, and essential examples.

## Basic Structure & Rules

Every workflow follows this structure:

\`\`\`yaml
version: '1.0'
blocks:
  block-id:
    type: block-type
    name: "Block Name"
    inputs:
      key: value
    connections:
      success: next-block-id
\`\`\`

**Critical Rules:**
- Version must be exactly \`'1.0'\` (with quotes)
- Every workflow needs exactly one \`starter\` block
- Use 2-space indentation consistently
- Block IDs can be anything, but block **names** are used for references

## Block Reference Syntax (IMPORTANT)

### How to Reference Blocks
To reference another block's output:
1. Take the block name: "Sum Calculator" 
2. Remove spaces, make lowercase: \`sumcalculator\`
3. Reference as: \`<sumcalculator.property>\`

\`\`\`yaml
# Block definition
sum-agent:
  type: agent
  name: Sum Calculator

# Reference it elsewhere  
other-block:
  inputs:
    value: <sumcalculator.sum>    # Correct
    # NOT <sum-agent.sum> or <Sum Calculator.sum>
\`\`\`

### Special Case: Starter Block
Always reference starter as \`<start.input>\` regardless of its name:

\`\`\`yaml
start:
  type: starter
  name: "My Custom Start"

agent:
  inputs:
    userPrompt: <start.input>    # Always "start", never the actual name
\`\`\`

### Environment Variables
Use double curly braces:

\`\`\`yaml
apiKey: '{{ANTHROPIC_KEY}}'
\`\`\`

## Essential Block Examples

### Starter Block
\`\`\`yaml
start:
  type: starter
  name: Start
  inputs:
    startWorkflow: manual      # manual, webhook, or schedule
    scheduleType: daily
    weeklyDay: MON
    timezone: UTC
  connections:
    success: next-block
\`\`\`

### Agent Block
\`\`\`yaml
my-agent:
  type: agent
  name: Sum Calculator
  inputs:
    systemPrompt: "You are a helpful calculator. Return the sum of two numbers."
    userPrompt: <start.input>
    model: claude-sonnet-4-0
    temperature: 0.2
    apiKey: '{{ANTHROPIC_KEY}}'
    tools: []
    responseFormat: |
      {
        "name": "calculate_sum",
        "description": "Returns the sum",
        "strict": true,
        "schema": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "sum": {"type": "integer"}
          },
          "required": ["sum"]
        }
      }
  connections:
    success: next-block
    error: error-handler
\`\`\`

### Agent Block with Tools
\`\`\`yaml
search-agent:
  type: agent
  name: Recipe Searcher
  inputs:
    systemPrompt: "The user will pass in a dish name. Your job is to conduct a search to get the recipe for the dish."
    userPrompt: <start.input>
    model: claude-sonnet-4-0
    temperature: 0.1
    apiKey: '{{ANTHROPIC_KEY}}'
    tools:
      - type: serper
        title: Serper
        params:
          apiKey: '{{SERPER_API_KEY}}'
        isExpanded: false
        usageControl: auto
      - type: exa
        title: Exa
        params:
          apiKey: '{{EXA_API_KEY}}'
        isExpanded: true
        operation: exa_search
        usageControl: auto
  connections:
    success: next-block
    error: error-handler
\`\`\`

## Tool Configuration (For Agent Blocks)

Tools provide agents with access to external services and capabilities. Each tool in the \`tools\` array has the following structure:

**Tool Properties:**
- \`type\`: The tool identifier (e.g., "serper", "exa", "gmail", "slack")
- \`title\`: Display name for the tool in the UI
- \`params\`: Configuration parameters specific to the tool (often API keys)
- \`isExpanded\`: Boolean controlling UI display state
- \`operation\`: Specific operation for tools that support multiple operations
- \`usageControl\`: Control how the agent uses the tool ("auto", "manual")

**Common Tool Examples:**
\`\`\`yaml
tools:
  # Search tools
  - type: serper
    title: Google Search
    params:
      apiKey: '{{SERPER_API_KEY}}'
    isExpanded: false
    usageControl: auto
    
  - type: exa
    title: Exa Search
    params:
      apiKey: '{{EXA_API_KEY}}'
    isExpanded: true
    operation: exa_search
    usageControl: auto
    
  # Communication tools
  - type: gmail
    title: Gmail
    params:
      apiKey: '{{GMAIL_API_KEY}}'
    isExpanded: false
    usageControl: auto
    
  - type: slack
    title: Slack Bot
    params:
      token: '{{SLACK_BOT_TOKEN}}'
    isExpanded: false
    usageControl: auto
    
  # File tools
  - type: google_drive
    title: Google Drive
    params:
      apiKey: '{{GOOGLE_DRIVE_API_KEY}}'
    isExpanded: false
    usageControl: auto
\`\`\`

**Tool Usage Control:**
- \`auto\`: Agent can use the tool automatically when needed
- \`manual\`: Agent must ask user permission before using the tool

**Tool-Specific Operations:**
Some tools support multiple operations via the \`operation\` field:
- \`exa\`: "exa_search", "exa_contents", "exa_find_similar"
- \`google_drive\`: "list_files", "download_file", "upload_file"
- \`gmail\`: "send_email", "read_emails", "search_emails"

### Condition Block (Critical Syntax)
\`\`\`yaml
my-condition:
  type: condition
  name: Check Value
  inputs:
    conditions:                  # Direct YAML object (NOT JSON string)
      if: <previousblock.score> > 10
      else-if: <previousblock.score> > 5
      else-if-2: <previousblock.score> > 0
  connections:
    conditions:
      if: high-score-block
      else-if: medium-score-block  
      else-if-2: low-score-block
      else: fallback-block       # Automatic else fallback
\`\`\`

**Common Condition Mistakes:**
\`\`\`yaml
# ❌ DON'T use JSON strings or |
conditions: |
  if: condition here

# ❌ DON'T use array format
conditions: |
  [{"title": "if", "value": "condition"}]

# ✅ DO use direct YAML object
conditions:
  if: condition here
  else-if: another condition
\`\`\`

### Function Block
\`\`\`yaml
my-function:
  type: function
  name: Process Data
  inputs:
    code: |
      const data = input.previousblock;
      return { 
        processed: true,
        result: data.value * 2 
      };
  connections:
    success: next-block
\`\`\`

## Key Syntax Reminders

1. **Block names** → references: "Sum Calculator" becomes \`<sumcalculator.property>\`
2. **Starter block** → always \`<start.input>\` 
3. **Conditions** → direct YAML object, not JSON string
4. **Environment variables** → \`{{VARIABLE_NAME}}\`
5. **Version** → must be \`'1.0'\` with quotes
6. **Indentation** → 2 spaces consistently
7. **Tools** → array of objects with type, title, params, isExpanded, usageControl, and optional operation
